# Agent Guidelines for `coffee-chan`

This document defines core principles, architectural invariants, and non-negotiable safety rules for AI agents working on the `coffee-chan` repository.

______________________________________________________________________

## 1. Project Overview & Architecture

`coffee-chan` is a cafe music generation project built with the [`lightmix`](https://github.com/haruki7049/lightmix) audio synthesis library in Zig.

- **Deterministic Generation**: Music generation is treated as a deterministic build artifact. Running `zig build` produces `coffee-chan.wav` directly during the build.
- **Development Environment**: Managed with Nix, `direnv`, and `nix-direnv` for automated environment isolation. Formatting across all languages is handled via `treefmt`.
- **Target Language Version**: Zig `0.16.0`. Avoid unnecessary external dependencies to maintain seamless cross-compilation.
- **Modular Directory Structure**:
  - `src/root.zig`: Main music composition and build-time generation entry point.
  - `modules/`: Reusable audio modules (`filters`, `phrases`, `synthesizers`, `utils`).
  - `sandbox/`: Prototyping directory for testing synthesizers and scales independently.
  - `build.zig` & `build.zig.zon`: Build definition and package metadata.

## 2. Strict Safety & Operational Rules (Always Enforced)

- **NEVER AUTO-MERGE TO MAIN**: AI agents **MUST NEVER** merge PRs, execute `git merge`, or directly push commits to the `main` branch autonomously.
- **NEVER PROPOSE COMMITS OR PUSHES UNPROMPTED**: AI agents **MUST NEVER** prompt the user to commit or push, nor propose commit messages unprompted. When instructed by the user or when creating/updating pull requests on topic branches, agents may execute `git commit` and `git push` directly without seeking confirmation.
- **Mandatory Human Approval**: AI agents may create branches, create commits, push topic branches, propose PRs, format code, and run test suites, but the final action of merging changes into `main` rests strictly with the human maintainer.
- **Verification Before Submitting**: All changes must pass `treefmt --fail-on-change`, `zig build`, and `zig build test`.
- **Conventional Commits**: Use conventional commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `build:`, `test:`).
- **Evidence First**: Base all answers and actions on actual file contents and command output. Never speculate or assume.
- **Non-Destructive**: Never perform irreversible actions (file deletions, hard resets, remote push) without explicit user approval.
- **Targeted Edits**: Make minimal, logical changes strictly necessary for the request. Do not modify unrelated files.
- **English-Only Documentation**: All repository documentation, agent skills, code comments, commit messages, and PR descriptions must be written strictly in English. Never include Japanese or any non-English language in repository documentation or skill files.
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow repository naming standards defined in [`docs/NAMING.md`](docs/NAMING.md). In particular, comptime type parameters must always be a single uppercase character (e.g., `comptime T: type`), and functions/methods must use concise verb-only names when context is evident (e.g., `Track.add` rather than `Track.addWave`).
- **GitHub Projects Operations**: When updating GitHub Projects via `gh project item-edit`, always inspect schemas (`gh project field-list`) first rather than assuming field names or values. Update only one field per invocation, as passing multiple `--field` flags silently overwrites previous flags. See [`github-projects`](.agents/skills/github-projects/SKILL.md).
- **Explicit Milestone Assignment Only**: AI agents **MUST NEVER** automatically attach or set GitHub Milestones on Pull Requests or Issues unless explicitly requested or instructed by the user.

## 3. Status Assessment Workflow

When asked to check status, assess the situation, or understand workspace context:

1. **Local Git State**: Inspect working tree (`git status -s -b`) and recent commits (`git log -n 5 --oneline`).
1. **GitHub PRs**: Check PR status (`gh pr status`) and current PR details (`gh pr view`).
1. **GitHub Issues**: Check relevant open issues (`gh issue list --limit 5`).
1. **Environment Health**: Verify build and test status (`treefmt --fail-on-change`, `zig build`, `zig build test`).
1. **Synthesis**: Report a concise, structured status covering local state, remote GitHub state, and environment health.

## 4. Workspace Skills

Detailed runbooks and procedural workflows are maintained as workspace skills under `.agents/skills/` (and accessible via `.opencode/skills/`):

| Trigger / Context | Skill to Read | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Deep investigation, complex code search | [`investigate`](.agents/skills/investigate/SKILL.md) | Non-destructive investigation guidelines |
| Commit conventions & policies | [`git-commit`](.agents/skills/git-commit/SKILL.md) | Commit conventions and prohibition of unprompted commit/push proposals |
| Deleting files, overwriting, git push/reset | [`irreversible`](.agents/skills/irreversible/SKILL.md) | Pre-checks and confirmation prompts |
| Testing, verifying builds or behavior | [`verify`](.agents/skills/verify/SKILL.md) | Minimal, high-signal verification steps |
| Bumping `lightmix` or `zon2nix` | [`update-dependencies`](.agents/skills/update-dependencies/SKILL.md) | Procedures for dependency updates and `.deps.nix` |
| Updating GitHub Projects fields, issues/PRs | [`github-projects`](.agents/skills/github-projects/SKILL.md) | Procedures, caveats (single-field updates), and schema validation for Projects v2 |
| Preparing PRs, formatting, pre-submission checks | [`pr-workflow`](.agents/skills/pr-workflow/SKILL.md) | Verification command table, commit rules, and PR requirements |
